    """
      To unpool the tensor after  max_pool_with_argmax.
      Argumnets:
          pooled:    the max pooled output tensor
          ind:       argmax indices , the second output of max_pool_with_argmax
          ksize:     ksize should be the same as what you have used to pool
      Returns:
          unpooled:      the tensor after unpooling
      Some points to keep in mind ::
          1. In tensorflow the indices in argmax are flattened, so that a maximum value at position [b, y, x, c] becomes flattened index ((b * height + y) * width + x) * channels + c
          2. Due to point 1, use broadcasting to appropriately place the values at their right locations !
